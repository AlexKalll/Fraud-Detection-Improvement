# Fraud-Detection-Improvement

## Project Overview

This project aims to significantly improve fraud detection capabilities for e-commerce and bank credit card transactions. In an era where digital transactions are increasingly prevalent, the financial sector faces an ongoing challenge from sophisticated fraudulent activities. This initiative, undertaken for Adey Innovations Inc., a leading financial technology company, focuses on developing robust and accurate fraud detection models.

The core objectives of this project include:
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis and Preprocessing:** Thoroughly clean, preprocess, and integrate diverse transactional datasets.
- **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Create impactful features that reveal subtle fraud patterns, including geolocation insights and time-based metrics.
- **Effective Imbalanced Learning:** Address the inherent class imbalance in fraud datasets (where legitimate transactions vastly outnumber fraudulent ones) using appropriate sampling techniques.
- **Model Building and Evaluation:** Develop and compare various machine learning models, including a baseline Logistic Regression and a powerful ensemble model (Random Forest or Gradient Boosting), evaluating them with metrics suited for imbalanced data (AUC-PR, F1-Score).
- **Model Explainability (XAI):** Interpret model decisions using tools like SHAP to understand the key drivers of fraud and build trust in the models.
- **Operational Efficiency and Trust:** Ultimately, the project aims to minimize financial losses due to fraud, maintain customer trust in online systems, ensure regulatory compliance, and reduce operational costs associated with manual fraud reviews and chargeback disputes. 

A critical aspect of this project is balancing the trade-off between security and user experience. False positives (legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged as fraud) can frustrate customers and lead to lost revenue, while false negatives (missed fraudulent transactions) result in direct financial losses. Our models will be evaluated to ensure an optimal balance between these competing costs.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alex/Fraud-Detection-Improvement.git
    cd Fraud-Detection-Improvement
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
4.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## How to Run the Code

The project workflow is designed to be sequential, primarily through the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory, leveraging functions from the `src/` directory.

1.  **Ensure data is in the `data/` directory.**
2.  **Launch Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    # or
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3.  **Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory** and open the notebooks in the following order:
    * `01_EDA.ipynb`: For initial data exploration and understanding.
    * `02_Feature_Engineering.ipynb`: To apply and understand engineered features.
    * `03_Modeling.ipynb`: For training and evaluating models.
    * `04_Explainability.ipynb`: To interpret the best-performing model.

Alternatively, for running specific scripts:

* **Data Preprocessing:**
    ```bash
    python src/data_preprocessing.py
    ```
* **Feature Engineering:**
    ```bash
    python src/feature_engineering.py
    ```
* **Model Training:**

* **EDA Implementation and Fraud Pattern Insight:** Clearly presenting visualizations and insights gained from exploratory data analysis.
* **Feature Engineering Logic and Implementation:** Justifying the creation of new features with clear explanations and hypotheses.
* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Accuracy:** Documenting all steps taken to clean and prepare the data, ensuring data quality.
* **Handling Class Imbalance:** Detailing the techniques applied to address the highly imbalanced nature of fraud datasets.
* **Code Structure, Functionality, and Documentation:** Maintaining clean, modular, and well-commented code, along with comprehensive READMEs and reports.
