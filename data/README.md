# Data for Fraud Detection Improvement Project

This directory contains the datasets used for the Fraud Detection Improvement project. Each dataset plays a crucial role in developing robust models for identifying fraudulent e-commerce and bank transactions.

## Datasets:

### 1. `Fraud_Data.csv`

This dataset contains e-commerce transaction data, primarily used for identifying fraudulent activities in online purchases. 

**Columns:**
* **`user_id`**: A unique identifier for the user who made the transaction. 
* **`signup_time`**: The timestamp when the user signed up on the platform. 
* **`purchase_time`**: The timestamp when the purchase was made. 
* **`purchase_value`**: The value of the purchase in US dollars. 
* **`device_id`**: A unique identifier for the device used to make the transaction. 
* **`source`**: The origin through which the user came to the site (e.g., 'SEO', 'Ads', 'Direct').
* **`browser`**: The web browser used for the transaction (e.g., 'Chrome', 'Safari', 'Firefox'). 
* **`sex`**: The gender of the user ('M' for male, 'F' for female). 
* **`age`**: The age of the user. 
* **`ip_address`**: The IP address from which the transaction was made. 
* **`class`**: The target variable. `1` indicates a fraudulent transaction, and `0` indicates a non-fraudulent (legitimate) transaction. 

**Critical Challenge:** This dataset exhibits a significant class imbalance, with a much smaller number of fraudulent transactions compared to legitimate ones. This characteristic necessitates careful selection of evaluation metrics and modeling techniques.

### 2. `creditcard.csv`

This dataset contains anonymized bank transaction data, specifically curated for credit card fraud detection analysis. It features principal components obtained with PCA to protect sensitive information. 

**Columns:**
* **`Time`**: The number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. [cite: 162]
* **`V1` to `V28`**: Anonymized features, which are the result of a PCA transformation. Their exact nature is not disclosed due to privacy, but they represent underlying patterns in the data. 
* **`Amount`**: The transaction amount in US dollars. 
* **`Class`**: The target variable. `1` indicates a fraudulent transaction, and `0` indicates a non-fraudulent transaction.

**Critical Challenge:** Similar to the e-commerce data, this dataset is extremely imbalanced, a common characteristic in real-world fraud detection problems.

### 3. `IpAddress_to_Country.csv`

This dataset provides a mapping of IP address ranges to their corresponding countries. It is used to enrich the `Fraud_Data.csv` by adding geographical information based on the transaction IP addresses. 

**Columns:**
* **`lower_bound_ip_address`**: The lower bound of an IP address range. 
* **`upper_bound_ip_address`**: The upper bound of an IP address range. 
* **`country`**: The country associated with the given IP address range.

## Processed Datasets:

This directory also contains the processed and engineered versions of the datasets, ready for model training. These files are generated by the `data_preprocessing.py` and `feature_engineering.py` scripts.

### 1. `Fraud_Data_Cleaned.csv`

This is the cleaned version of `Fraud_Data.csv` after initial preprocessing (handling missing values, duplicates, and initial data type corrections).

### 2. `creditcard_Cleaned.csv`

This is the cleaned version of `creditcard.csv` after initial preprocessing (handling missing values and duplicates). **1081 duplicate rows were removed** from this dataset during cleaning.

### 3. `fraud_data_final_engineered_scaled.csv`

This file contains the e-commerce fraud data after:
* Merging with `IpAddress_to_Country.csv` to add the `country` feature.
* Creating time-based features (`hour_of_day`, `day_of_week`, `time_since_signup`).
* Creating transaction frequency and velocity features (`user_transaction_count`, `device_transaction_count`, `user_velocity`, `device_velocity`).
* One-Hot Encoding of categorical features (`source`, `browser`, `sex`, `country`).
* Standard Scaling of numerical features.

**Final Columns:** `user_id`, `signup_time`, `purchase_time`, `purchase_value`, `device_id`, `age`, `ip_address`, `class`, `hour_of_day`, `day_of_week`, `time_since_signup`, `user_transaction_count`, `device_transaction_count`, `user_velocity`, `device_velocity`, and one-hot encoded columns for `source`, `browser`, `sex`, and `country`.

### 4. `creditcard_data_final_scaled.csv`

This file contains the credit card fraud data after:
* Standard Scaling of all numerical features (`Time`, `V1` to `V28`, `Amount`).

**Final Columns:** `Time`, `V1`, `V2`, `V3`, `V4`, `V5`, `V6`, `V7`, `V8`, `V9`, `V10`, `V11`, `V12`, `V13`, `V14`, `V15`, `V16`, `V17`, `V18`, `V19`, `V20`, `V21`, `V22`, `V23`, `V24`, `V25`, `V26`, `V27`, `V28`, `Amount`, `Class`.
